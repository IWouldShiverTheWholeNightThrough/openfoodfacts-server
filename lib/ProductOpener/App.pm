=head1 NAME

ProductOpener::App - the ProductOpener application

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An instance of this class is created at application startup time.
The object holds long-term information, like for example
paths to various directories.

Short-term information related to the HTTP request lifecycle
should go into L<ProductOpener::Controller> or its subobjects
(L<ProductOpener::Request>, L<ProductOpener::Response>).

	my $self = bless {}, $class;

	$self->init_file_timestamps;




	# On demand exports can be very big, limit the number of products
	$self->{export_limit} = 10000;

	# TODO: explain why such a high number
	$self->{tags_page_size} = 10000;

	if (defined $options{export_limit}) {
		$self->{export_limit} = $options{export_limit};
	}

	# Save all tag types to index in a set to make checks easier
	$self->{index_tag_types_set}{$_} = undef foreach @ProductOpener::Config::index_tag_types;


	$self->{default_request_ref} = {page => 1,};



	$self->{static_subdomain} = format_subdomain('static');
	$self->{images_subdomain} = format_subdomain('images');

# 	return format_subdomain($prefix);
# }



=head2 TODO REWRITE DOC %file_timestamps

When the module is loaded (at the start of Apache with mod_perl), we record the modification date
of static files like CSS styles an JS code so that we can add a version parameter to the request
in order to make sure the browser will not serve an old cached version.
